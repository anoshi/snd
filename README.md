# SEARCH AND DESTROY

This campaign-only game mode is based on Counter Strike's Bomb Defusal, Hostage Rescue, and Assassination missions.

**Demolition** stages see Terrorists planting a bomb in one of two target areas. The Counter Terrorists must find and disarm it before it detonates.

In **Hostage Rescue** mode, the Counter Terrorists must find the hostages and escort them to an extraction point.

**Assassination** mode requires the Counter Terrorists to escort a VIP to an extraction point without being eliminated by the Terrorists.

_Note_: While this mod is intended for multiplayer PVP, you are able to try it out in local, single-player mode. When the game has loaded, press `enter` to open a text window then type `/start` and hit `enter` again. This will bypass the 2-player minimum requirement. Be aware you will be alone without human or AI opposition!

## Gameplay

### Assassination

1. A VIP unit (AI-controlled) spawns near one of the Counter Terrorists (or Terrorists if no Counter Terrorists are playing) at the start of the mission. Counter Terrorist units must work together to escort the VIP to an extraction point before the round timer expires;
1. The Terrorists can prevent the VIP's extraction or eliminate all Counter Terrorist units and the VIP to secure victory in this game mode.

* The VIP wears heavy armour and carries a suppressed pistol;
* The location of the VIP is advertised to Counter Terrorists only, unless it is the only surviving Counter Terrorist unit.

### Hostage Rescue

1. Four hostages spawn at randomised locations at the start of these levels. Counter Terrorists must find the hostages (they're marked on screen edges and map overlay) and escort them - one or more at a time - to a designated extraction area near the Terrorists' starting area;
1. At least one Terrorist must survive and prevent the Counter Terrorists from rescuing more than two of the hostages in order to win the round.

* A significant penalty is applied to any character who kills a hostage.

### Demolition

1. At the start of each round, a soldier from the Terrorist faction (or a Counter Terrorist if no Terrorists are playing) is chosen at random to be the bomb carrier. The bomb is added to this unit's backpack.
1. Soldiers on the other team all have wire cutters added to their backpacks;
1. Two bomb targets are selected at random and marked on the screen / screen-edges and minimap. The bomb must be planted close to one of these areas. The bomb takes ~7 seconds to plant and arm (hold LMB / fire);
1. The bombing team must defend the armed bomb for ~60 seconds. The defusing team must find the bomb (in one of the locations) and use the wire cutters or the faster defusal kit at the bomb location (immediately next to the flashing bomb indicator) to defuse the bomb and win the round.
1. The round winner is awarded based on whether the bomb detonates or is defused, one team has no units left alive, or the round timer expires.

* This bomb carrier is marked (to friendly units only) every 5 seconds. The idea here is that if you are carrying the bomb, your teammates will be able to find you and keep you safe;
* The bomb and wire cutters are secondary weapons. Move them into the appropriate slot in your character's inventory
* The armed bomb flashes and emits an audible beep to indicate it is live
* An armed bomb takes ~7 seconds to defuse with wire cutters and even less time with the defusal kit (hold LMB / fire);

## Future improvements
